	-Program config and DB config now serialized (and used!)
	-Added Database configurer dialog
	-DBs are now loaded from external files based on DB config (cached to "app-dir\DBs\" folder)
	-Preffered DB added to program config (to allow user to change from No-Intro)
	-Added error details dialog

9/15/2013
	-Now respects hash specified in DB config (ROM vs File) when parsing ClrMamePro DATs (important because No-Intro uses ROM hashes, TOSEC uses file hashes)
	
9/16/2013
	-Genesis internal header now decoded and displayed in tab
	-Added 'ImportantFields' to program config, which will be shown in bold in the details display.
	-Can now copy entries from the details tabs

10/7/2013

10/8/2013
	-Added GBA.cs and Platform_GBA.cs
	-Added SMS.cs, Platform_MasterSystem.cs, Platform_GameGear.cs
10/9/2013
	-Added N64.cs, Platform_N64.cs
10/10/2013
	-Moved hashing code to a separate thread
		-display "hashing animation" while working (for longer running processes)
		-User can press escape to abort long running process 
		-User can not open additional files while hashing is in progress
	-N64 hashing is now multi-threaded
	-Added Platform_NDS, Platform_NGP
	-DS hashing is multi-threaded
	-Added platform disambiguation dialog

10/11/2013
	-Platform disambiguation dialog is presented if platform is not auto-detected, or if user performs "Open As"
	-Databases are now re-loaded after configuration
	-Databases can now be configured to work with "Unknown" and misc platforms.
	-Fixed some bugs with out-of-range access on files that are unexpectedly small
	-Rewrote all Platform.CalculateHashes methods to delegate actual work to HashJob, which can omit unneeded hashes and help manage multithreaded execution.
	-Extensive organization/code documentation
	
10/12/2013
	-Fixed race condition in multi-threaded task queue
